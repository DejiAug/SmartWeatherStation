           Smart Weather Station is designed to track the weather of your local environment in a smart way that is easy and well convenient for you. 
           <p>
           It uses several different sensors, they are; Anemometer for Wind speed, Humidity sensor, Temperature sensor, Raindrops sensor and an Air pressure sensor, all constructed together in the Arduino code along with a Bluetooth module that makes it amazingly comfortable for you to track the weather data from your smartphone. 
           <p>The Smart Weather Station uses a webpage constructed by HTML and CSS styling that is very responsive, which means the layout of the webpage changes when you make the browser smaller or bigger. The Webpage displays the sensors reading from the Arduino code with the help of a website called ThingSpeak which is embedded to my actual website in the HTML code, Iâ€™m using a website domain called x10hosting to publish my website online so anyone can view it, with all of these put together it makes Smart Weather Station convenient for you.
